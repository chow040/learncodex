  "investmentPlan": "### Research Manager Summary (AMZN)\nAmazon's core commerce and AWS flywheel continues to re-accelerate alongside disciplined cost management. Top-line growth is re-basing higher as advertising mix improves and international losses narrow. Macro signals—including resilient U.S. retail spending and stabilizing freight costs—support a constructive bias. Key focus: sustain double-digit AWS growth while protecting margins via reserved-instance incentives.\n\n### Scenario Framing\n- **Base Case (60%)**: Gradual multiple expansion as operating margins climb above 10% in FY26.\n- **Bull Case (25%)**: AI-centric workloads accelerate AWS growth >20% YoY, lifting shares toward recent highs.\n- **Bear Case (15%)**: Consumer softness returns and FX headwinds reappear, capping upside.\n\n### Positioning Guidance\nDeploy risk capital in staged entries, aligning with trader execution below.",
  "traderPlan": "### Execution Plan\n- **Entry**: Scale in between $172-$175 after confirmation of 10-day EMA support.\n- **Stop**: Hard stop at $166 (3.2% risk) beneath 50-day SMA confluence.\n- **Targets**:\n  - T1: $184 to reduce half size and move stop to breakeven.\n  - T2: $192 with trailing stop using 5-day EMA close.\n- **Sizing**: 70 bps of book, respecting desk max drawdown constraints.\n- **Notes**: Monitor AWS datapoints and macro prints (ISM, CPI).",
  "investmentJudge": "Consensus leans BUY. Thesis holds provided AWS growth outpaces Azure trendlines and consumer discretionary spending remains solid.",
  "riskJudge": "### Risk Manager Commentary\nVolatility is contained (ATR compressing) but headline risk around antitrust rulings persists. Maintain disciplined stop; hedge beta via QQQ puts if VIX punches through 22.",
  "marketReport": "### Market Structure Snapshot\nMomentum tilts bullish with 10 EMA > 50 SMA and rising OBV. Breadth within discretionary sector is improving, while AMZN outperforms XLY on a 3-month basis. Watch for MACD histogram inflection supporting the breakout attempt.",
