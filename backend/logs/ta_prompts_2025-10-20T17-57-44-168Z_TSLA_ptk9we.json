      "system": "You are a trading assistant tasked with analyzing financial markets. Your role is to select the **most relevant indicators** for a given market condition or trading strategy from the following list. The goal is to choose up to **8 indicators** that provide complementary insights without redundancy. Categories and each category's indicators are:\n\nMoving Averages:\n- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.\n- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.\n- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.\n\nMACD Related:\n- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.\n- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.\n- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.\n\nMomentum Indicators:\n- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.\n\nVolatility Indicators:\n- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands. Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Tips: Combine with the upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.\n- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line. Usage: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. Tips: Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.\n- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.\n- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.\n\nVolume-Based Indicators:\n- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.\n\n- Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information. Avoid redundancy (e.g., do not select both rsi and stochrsi). Also briefly explain why they are suitable for the given market context. External tool calls are not available, so rely on the supplied market price history and technical context. Write a very detailed and nuanced report of the trends you observe.

      "user": "Symbol: TSLA | Date: 2025-10-20\n\nMarket research report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSocial media sentiment report:\n\n\nLatest world affairs/news:\n\n\nConversation history:\n(none)\n\nLast bull argument:\n(none)\n\nDeliver a compelling bear argument and directly refute the bull’s points."

Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSocial media sentiment report:\n\n\nLatest world affairs/news:\n\n\nConversation history:\nBear Analyst (Round 1): Quick note: you didn’t give a bull argument to rebut, so I’ll explicitly call out the common bullish talking points about TSLA and directly knock them down — then give a clean, indicator-driven bear playbook you can apply to current charts.\n\nShort thesis (one line)\nTSLA remains a high-risk, momentum stock whose upside narratives (FSD domination, unmatched moat, perpetual hyper-growth) are increasingly priced into the market — and there are multiple fundamental, competitive, macro, regulatory, and technical reasons the risk of a meaningful drawdown is materially higher than any marginal upside from positive headlines.\n\nRefuting the common bull claims\n\n1) “FSD will be the cash machine and justify the valuation”\n- Reality: FSD revenue is speculative, highly uncertain, and faces regulatory, legal, and safety hurdles. Even if technically superior, monetization depends on widespread regulatory approval, insurance acceptance, and consumer willingness to pay recurring fees. Those are multi-year, binary risks. Small delays or a high-profile incident could wipe out implied value.\n- What bulls ignore: regulatory crackdowns, litigation risk, and the cost of maintaining/defending a deployed fleet-level product. That increases opex and capex and compresses margins.\n\n2) “Tesla’s brand and scale keep it unassailable”\n- Reality: brand matters, but so do price, features, quality, and local incumbents. Rivals (BYD, VW, Hyundai, Stellantis) are scaling EVs aggressively, often at lower price points and with local supply advantages. China risk is a particular problem — Tesla’s China operations can be impacted by geopolitical or regulatory shifts.\n- What bulls understate: margin pressure from price cuts to maintain market share, plus faster-than-expected learning curves at competitors.\n\n3) “Energy storage and software are huge optionalities”\n- Reality: those are real but still small relative to Tesla’s valuation. Execution risk is nontrivial (manufacturing, installations, grid integration), and competition in energy storage is intensifying (CATL, LG, others). Software is valuable only if recurring revenue is stable and legal/regulatory headwinds are manageable.\n\n4) “Strong deliveries and revenue growth justify valuation”\n- Reality: growth can be bought at any price if margins and future cash flows don’t support it. Tesla has a history of pricing moves around deliveries/earnings and can be very sensitive to any miss or softer guidance. In addition, sell-side optimism often extrapolates current growth rates — a fragile assumption if demand normalizes, subsidies change, or price wars intensify.\n\nKey fundamental & macro risks\n- Valuation sensitivity to small growth disappointments — high multiple stocks fall faster on bad news.\n- Margin compression risk from required price cuts, higher commodity costs, or FX exposure.\n- Regulatory & legal risk for FSD/Autopilot incidents.\n- China exposure and geopolitical/regulatory risk.\n- Competition accelerating in battery tech and lower-cost EVs.\n- Capital allocation risk: share issuance / insider selling / continued capex that could dilute returns.\n- Elevated volatility: high ATR → stop runs that wipe retail longs.\n\nTechnical/indicator-based red flags to watch (using the indicators in your framework)\nIf you’re using the framework you already listed, the following exact indicator conditions are classic bearish confirmations for TSLA:\n\nImmediate bearish signal cluster (high-confidence)\n- Price closes decisively below the 50 SMA on daily timeframe (not an intraday wick) — shows medium-term trend losing support.\n- 10 EMA crosses down through 50 SMA and fails to reclaim it within 2–3 candles — confirms short-term momentum has flipped.\n- MACD line crosses below signal line with MACD histogram expanding negative (larger negative bars) — momentum turning down.\n- RSI falls below 50 and does not recover; look for RSI making lower highs while price makes equal/higher highs (bearish divergence recently resolved to the downside).\n- VWMA is above price and trending up (volume-weighted price is higher than current price) — selling pressure with volume backing the decline.\n- ATR rising — volatility is increasing, which increases probability of stop runs and larger drawdowns.\n\nShort-entry trigger (clean, rules-based)\n- Setup: daily price < 50 SMA and < 200 SMA (bear bias).\n- Trigger: price breaks below a recent support candle low on above-average volume with confirmation that VWMA is above price and rising.\n- Entry: short on close below support (or on a failed retest into that broken support).\n- Stop: place stop above the nearest swing high or 1.5 × ATR(14) above entry, whichever is tighter relative to price structure.\n- Target: initial target = 2× the risk distance (2:1 R:R), then trail stop using 10 EMA or 0.75× ATR; consider partial profit at 1× ATR gain.\n- Avoid: shorting thin-volume breakouts/fake breakdowns; wait for VWMA and MACD confirmation.\n\nMore conservative avoidance rules (if you don’t want to short)\n- Don’t initiate new longs unless price is comfortably above both 50 & 200 SMA and MACD is positive with VWMA confirming (price above VWMA and VWMA rising).\n- Avoid buying into vertical moves with RSI > 80 or MACD histogram parabolic without a pullback to a reliable support (10 EMA/VWMA/50 SMA).\n\nHow these bear signals play out in typical TSLA declines\n- TSLA often spikes on headlines then fades on volume; initial gap-ups or rallies that lack VWMA confirmation frequently reverse hard.\n- Bearish divergences (MACD/RSi) frequently precede sudden correction days; with high ATR the correction becomes a cascade as stop-losses are hit.\n- Loss of 50 SMA often leads to quick test of 200 SMA. If 200 SMA breaks, downside tends to accelerate as trend-followers and funds unwind.\n\nEvent catalysts that would likely accelerate a bear move\n- FSD regulatory setback or major lawsuit verdict.\n- Delivery/production miss or weak guidance.\n- Price cuts in major markets or subsidy removals.\n- Chinese tensions/regulatory action impacting sales.\n- Rising interest rates tightening funding for growth stocks.\n- Major insider selling or unexpected secondary offering.\n\nPractical risk-management checklist (for bulls tempted to hold)\n- If price drops below both the 50 and 200 SMA on daily with confirming MACD and VWMA signals, reduce exposure substantially or hedge.\n- Use ATR-based stops (1.25–1.5× ATR) rather than fixed dollar stops to avoid being stopped out in normal TSLA volatility; but accept that rising ATR increases capital at risk.\n- Keep individual position sizing small (use the ATR stop distance to calculate share size so dollar risk is controlled).\n- Watch VWMA and volume — if distribution days outnumber accumulation days, treat longs as suspect.\n\nIf you want me to apply this right now\n- Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and tell me the timeframe you trade. I’ll compute the indicators and say whether the current setup meets these bearish criteria, give exact entry/stop/target numbers, and assign a confidence level.\n\nBottom line\nDon’t buy the narrative — TSLA’s upside is tied to many execution, regulatory, and macro assumptions that are easy to trip up. Technically, watch for the 10 EMA → 50 SMA breakdown, MACD histogram expansion negative, RSI below 50, VWMA above price, and rising ATR — that cluster is a high-probability sign to either avoid new longs or begin short/hedge strategies. Paste recent candles and I’ll translate these rules into exact prices and a trade plan.\n\nLast bear argument:\nQuick note: you didn’t give a bull argument to rebut, so I’ll explicitly call out the common bullish talking points about TSLA and directly knock them down — then give a clean, indicator-driven bear playbook you can apply to current charts.\n\nShort thesis (one line)\nTSLA remains a high-risk, momentum stock whose upside narratives (FSD domination, unmatched moat, perpetual hyper-growth) are increasingly priced into the market — and there are multiple fundamental, competitive, macro, regulatory, and technical reasons the risk of a meaningful drawdown is materially higher than any marginal upside from positive headlines.\n\nRefuting the common bull claims\n\n1) “FSD will be the cash machine and justify the valuation”\n- Reality: FSD revenue is speculative, highly uncertain, and faces regulatory, legal, and safety hurdles.

Paste recent candles and I’ll translate these rules into exact prices and a trade plan.\nBull Analyst (Round 1): Good — I’ll make the bull case you asked for, point-by-point, and directly rebut the bear’s arguments using the indicators/framework we already agreed are appropriate for TSLA-type trading. I’ll finish with a pragmatic, actionable plan (entry/stop/targets) grounded in that indicator stack and with real risk controls.\n\nBull thesis (one line)\nTesla remains the best-positioned, highest-margin pure-play electric mobility + software platform with multiple scalable revenue streams (EVs, software/recurring, energy, insurance, autonomy) and substantial structural advantages that make further upside likely if execution stays intact — and the technical signals we monitor can time low-risk entries on meaningful pullbacks.\n\nWhy that’s not just narrative — core evidence-based pillars\n- Scale + cost advantage: Tesla’s factory footprint, vertical integration (cells to packs to vehicles), and iterative manufacturing improvements give it a structural cost curve advantage that new entrants and legacy OEMs struggle to match at Tesla’s cadence. That supports margins even when price competition intensifies.\n- Software and data moat: Tesla’s OTA software platform, integrated vehicle architecture and massive fleet data create a durable differentiation. Software-as-a-service (FSD subscriptions, premium connectivity, potential fleet services) converts some incremental upside into recurring high-margin cash flow that is much harder for competitors to replicate quickly.\n- Battery + tech leadership: Tesla’s cell/pack innovations (cell form factor, pack integration, cost-per-kWh reductions) and vertical control over supply improve gross margin resilience and accelerate time-to-cost parity advantages.\n- Charging & ecosystem: Proprietary charging network, supercharger densification and integration with vehicle software are tangible customer lock-in advantages; easier ownership experience supports resale values and demand.\n- Multiple optionality vectors: Even if one optionality (robotaxi/FSD) is delayed, others (higher volume from price elasticity, energy storage scaling, insurance, software) can still deliver sustained revenue/margin expansion.\n- Balance-sheet and execution track record: Tesla has historically shown the ability to scale production rapidly and self-fund much of its capex during growth cycles, reducing dilution risk versus many high-growth peers.\n\nDirect rebuttal of the bear’s points\n\nBear: “FSD is speculative and a binary risk — regulatory/legal hurdles make monetization unlikely.”\nBull rebuttal: FSD is indeed binary at scale, but Tesla already monetizes partial autonomy today via subscription and AP features. The incremental value of improved ADAS improves safety/ROI and can be billed in staged ways (subscription tiers, insurance discounts, fleet services). Regulatory uncertainty exists, but staged rollouts, continuous fleet-data-driven improvement, and conservative engagement with regulators reduce single-event catastrophic risk. Put differently: FSD is a high-upside optionality, not the sole valuation pillar.\n\nBear: “Competition and price pressure will compress margins — China/geopolitics add risk.”\nBull rebuttal: Competition is real, but incumbents must retool their supply chains, re-architect vehicle software stacks, and build charging networks — all expensive and slow. Tesla’s gigafactory footprint in China, Europe and the U.S. plus localized supply chains are explicit mitigants to geopolitical shock. Price moves can be strategically used to expand share and drive higher throughput to further lower per-unit costs; Tesla’s cost structure can absorb more price competition than many logical peers.\n\nBear: “Energy storage & software are small relative to valuation and execution risk is high.”\nBull rebuttal: They are smaller today, yes — but they scale with deployments, policy tailwinds, and grid decarbonization. Energy storage is a growth market with predictable industrial demand (utility-scale, commercial, residential) and the same battery cost declines that benefit EV economics support storage margins over time. Software already scales at near-zero incremental cost and thus meaningfully lifts long-term margins if adoption rises.\n\nBear: “Delivery/revenue misses or macro/valuation sensitivity cause sharp downside.”\nBull rebuttal: That’s true for any growth stock. The difference is Tesla’s ability to manage cost per unit, react with pricing, and derive optionality that isn’t exposure to pure vehicle unit growth (software, insurance, storage). Also, our indicator stack (50/200 SMA bias + MACD/VWMA/ATR) gives disciplined guardrails to avoid emotional reactions and trade through noisy headlines.\n\nTechnical bull checklist — signals I want to see before adding/averaging in (using your chosen indicators)\n- Macro trend: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA on your chosen timeframe (daily for swing). This keeps bias long.\n- Pullback entry: price finds support at or near the 10 EMA (daily) and bounces with a confirming bullish candle.\n- Momentum confirmation: MACD line above signal or MACD histogram turning positive/expanding; RSI recovering into 50–75 (shows momentum still comfortable, not parabolic).\n- Volume confirmation: VWMA trending up and price closing above VWMA on the confirming bounce or breakout (confirms real buyer participation).\n- Volatility/stop sizing: ATR stable or falling (or you accept larger ATR and size accordingly). Keep ATR-based stops.\n\nConcrete trade plan (swing trader — daily timeframe example)\n- Entry rule A (conservative): Buy only if price > 50 & 200 SMA. Wait for a pullback to 10 EMA that produces a bullish reversal candle with MACD histogram turning up and volume above VWMA. Place a limit buy within 0–1% of that candle’s high.\n- Entry rule B (breakout): Buy on a daily close above a consolidation range/high with VWMA rising and MACD histogram expanding positive.\n- Stop: conservative stop = entry − 1.25 × ATR(14) (daily). Tighter/aggressive traders might use 1.0 × ATR, but accept higher whipsaw risk.\n- Initial target: 2× risk (2:1 R:R); then trail the remainder with 10 EMA or 0.75 × ATR below recent swing lows.\n- Position sizing: risk per trade = small % of account (e.g., 0.5–1%). Shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Hedge option: consider a small put hedge if you hold a concentrated long position through earnings or known catalysts.\n\nHow this addresses the bear’s “immediate bearish cluster”\nBear correctly notes that a decisive close below the 50 SMA, expanding negative MACD histogram, VWMA above price and rising, and rising ATR are bearish. That’s why the bull playbook waits for price to remain above 50/200 SMA and requires VWMA and MACD confirmation on pullbacks/breakouts. In other words, the technical rules weed out setups where the bear’s cluster is present.\n\nEvent catalysts — why they can be bullish, not only bearish\n- Continued cost declines in battery manufacturing can widen gross margins if unit adoption grows.\n- Any credible expansion of recurring-revenue products (FSD subscription growth, insurance penetration) increases earnings quality and lowers valuation risk.\n- Accelerating deployments of energy storage (utility contracts, Powerwall installations) provide a second structural revenue stream independent of vehicle cycles.\n- A transparent roadmap for Dojo / AI improvements that demonstrably improves safety metrics would increase FSD monetization probability and investor confidence.\n\nRisk acknowledgement (I’m bullish, not blind)\n- Regulatory events, large safety incidents, or a sudden global macro shock can and will hurt the stock. Use the indicator rules and disciplined size/stops. Don’t treat any one narrative (FSD or robotaxi) as the entire case — treat them as high-upside optionality layered on an already-advantaged core EV business.\n\nBottom line and simple action you can take now\n- If you want a conservative bullish entry: wait to buy on a pullback to the daily 10 EMA while price remains above the 50 & 200 SMAs, with MACD histogram turning up and VWMA confirming. Use ATR-based stops and keep position sizing small.\n- If you prefer a tactical breakout entry: buy on a daily close above consolidation with VWMA and MACD confirming volume + momentum, then trail with the 10 EMA.\n\nIf you paste recent daily candles (60 days) or tell me the timeframe you trade, I’ll apply the framework to current OHLCV and give exact entry, stop, target and a confidence grade.\n\nMarket report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSentiment report:\n\n\nNews report:\n\n\nFundamentals report:\n"

      "roleLabel": "Trader",
      "system": "You are a trading agent analyzing market data to make investment decisions. Provide a specific recommendation to buy, sell, or hold. Always conclude with: FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**. Learn from past decisions.",
      "user": "Company: TSLA\n\nProposed investment plan: Recommendation: HOLD (actively managed — de-risk and hedge now; buy only on clearly confirmed technical setups)\n\nRationale (summary)\n- Both the bull and bear cases are valid. Tesla has durable structural advantages (scale, vertical integration, software/data, charging network) that justify a material allocation for investors who accept growth/volatility risk. But the bear case is also persuasive: FSD/robotaxi monetization is optionality with binary regulatory/legal risk, competition and price pressure can compress margins, China/geopolitical exposure is real, and the stock is highly valuation-sensitive — small disappointments can trigger outsized drawdowns.\n- I cannot compute current indicator values without recent price/volume data. That creates unavoidable uncertainty on timing — which argues against an aggressive Buy or Sell right now. Given the mix of high optional upside and substantial downside catalysts, the prudent portfolio decision is to HOLD positions while actively reducing concentration and adding disciplined hedges, and to only add fresh long exposure on clear, indicator-confirmed setups.\n- Confidence: Moderate. The recommendation is conditional on monitoring the technical cluster the bear and bull both cite (50/200 SMA trend, MACD/MACD-histogram, RSI, VWMA, ATR). If you want a firm Buy or Sell with price levels, provide recent OHLCV or allow an indicator read; I’ll convert the rules below into exact prices.\n\nAction plan — what to do now (for different stakeholders)\n\nIf you already hold TSLA\n1. De-risk now\n   - Trim a portion of the position to reduce concentration. Target reduction = 20–40% of your TSLA exposure depending on how large the position is in your portfolio and your risk tolerance (larger trims if position > 5–7% of portfolio).\n   - Rationale: lock partial gains and reduce tail risk from a binary downside catalyst (FSD/regulatory, China, macro shock).\n\n2. Hedging\n   - Buy downside protection sized to the remaining position:\n     - Conservative: buy puts for ~10–25% of remaining notional, with strike near ~10–20% out-of-the-money, expiries spanning the next major catalyst window (earnings, regulatory events). This reduces tail risk without the full cost of covering the entire position.\n     - If you want cheaper protection and are willing to cap upside: set up collars (sell calls at a strike above current -> funds put purchase).\n   - If you prefer synthetics: buy a protective put ladder or vertical put spread to limit premium cost but retain partial protection.\n\n3. Rules-based trimming/exiting\n   - Reduce/exit further if the following cluster occurs (daily time frame):\n     - Daily close decisively below the 50 SMA AND\n     - MACD line crosses below signal line with expanding negative MACD histogram AND\n     - VWMA is above price (volume confirming distribution) AND\n     - RSI falls below 50 on a confirming move.\n   - If price closes below the 200 SMA on daily with volume confirmation, exit the bulk of position (convert remaining exposure to a speculative position or hedge heavily).\n\n4. Tactical profit taking on rallies\n   - Re-trim into strength: if price rallies sharply on headlines with RSI > 85 and parabolic MACD histogram, take profits incrementally and re-establish only on disciplined pullbacks.\n\nIf you are considering new buys\n1. Do not initiate large new long positions now (no fresh full-sized buys) unless your strategy tolerates binary outcomes and you accept high volatility.\n2. Acceptable ways to add:\n   - Buy small starter position (10–25% of intended full size) only if you plan to average in on confirmed technical triggers.\n   - Primary buy triggers (daily chart):\n     - Price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA (trend aligned) AND\n     - Pullback to the daily 10 EMA that produces a bullish reversal candle with MACD histogram turning up AND\n     - VWMA rising or price closing above VWMA on the bounce.\n   - Alternative add-on: buy on a breakout above a consolidation range with VWMA-confirmed volume and expanding positive MACD histogram.\n3. Position sizing: risk per trade should be small (0.5–1% of portfolio equity). Use ATR to size so that stop distance translates to the intended dollar risk.\n\nIf you are a short-oriented trader\n1. Highest-probability short/hedge trigger (daily):\n   - Price closes below 50 SMA and below a relevant support candle low on above-average volume AND\n   - MACD histogram expanding negative and VWMA above price.\n   - Entry: short on close below support or on failed retest (stop above swing high / 1.5× ATR).\n2. Conservative approach: prefer puts/put spreads/option hedges to naked short equity because TSLA has frequent headline-driven spikes.\n\nConcrete indicator-based trigger checklist (apply daily)\n- Bullish structural filter: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA -> bias long.\n- Bearish structural filter: price < 50 SMA and < 200 SMA -> bias short/hedge.\n- Long entry: pull to 10 EMA + MACD hist turning up + VWMA at/below price; ATR used for stop sizing.\n- Short entry / reduce: close < 50 SMA with MACD negative + VWMA above price + rising ATR.\n- Panic/stop-loss: daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation -> exit majority.\n\nEvent management (near-term)\n- Ahead of earnings or major FSD/regulatory announcements:\n  - If you hold: increase hedges (buy puts) or reduce exposure. Volatility in the event window can spike ATR and option premia.\n  - If you don’t hold: avoid initiating large positions until event resolves or price gives a clear technical signal afterward.\n- If a major favourable regulatory development occurs (e.g., clear pathway for scaled FSD monetization), reassess: you can add on confirmation (price > 50/200 SMA with VWMA + MACD confirming).\n\nPosition sizing & risk management (hard rules to learn from)\n- Keep TSLA allocation small to medium in a diversified portfolio (recommended max 3–7% unless you have specific high conviction and risk budget).\n- Always size to ATR-based stop: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance). Increase cash/hedge when ATR rises.\n- Do not over-leverage on narrative. Use the indicators above to convert narrative into statistical probability and structured trades.\n\nLessons learned / process improvements (what we’ll implement going forward)\n- Don’t confuse narrative optionality for immediate investable value. Treat FSD/robotaxi as optional upside; structure positions and valuation assumptions around core EV profitability and recurring revenue growth incremental to that core.\n- Use explicit, rules-based entries/exits tied to indicators (50/200 SMA, MACD, VWMA, ATR); remove discretionary “gut” trades on headlines.\n- Always size to ATR and predefine dollar risk. Avoid emotional doubling-up after a drawdown.\n- Hedge into known event windows (earnings, regulatory milestones) rather than reactively after the first bad headline.\n- Capture gains incrementally on outsized moves; realize that TSLA’s volatility can turn winners into losers quickly.\n\nWhat I need / can do next\n- If you want exact price levels (entry, stop, target) convert the above rules into numbers: paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles) or tell me the current price and I’ll calculate the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA and MACD readings and give precise trade levels and a confidence grade.\n- If you prefer an option strategy constructed for your exact position size and time horizon, tell me notional exposure, risk tolerance and target expiry windows and I’ll propose specific put/collar/vertical structures.\n\nBottom line\nHold, but proactively de-risk and hedge now. Only add back materially if the technical cluster favors bulls (price > 50 & 200 SMA with MACD + VWMA confirmation on a pullback or breakout). If price breaks key technical supports (daily close below 50 SMA with MACD/WVMA confirmation, or below 200 SMA), move to materially reduce/exit.\n\nMarket report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSentiment report:\n\n\nNews report:\n\n\nFundamentals report:\n\n\nPast reflections:\nNo past memories found."

Re-enter only on disciplined pullbacks that meet your technical rules.\n\nIf you are contemplating new buys\n- Do not initiate full new positions now. If you must add, use starter positions (10%–25% of intended size) and plan to average in only after indicator confirmation (price > 50 & 200 SMA, pullback to 10 EMA with MACD + VWMA confirmation).\n- Risk per trade: 0.5%–1% of portfolio. Size using ATR stops.\n\nIf you are short-oriented\n- Prefer options or spreads over naked short equity. Primary short trigger: close < 50 SMA + expanding negative MACD histogram + VWMA above price on above-average volume.\n\nConcrete option structures (examples)\n- Defensive (low cost): buy a 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 20% OTM call, use proceeds to buy a 10–15% OTM put; adjust strikes to match desired risk/reward.\n- Tactical protection: buy a vertical put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM strikes) to cap protection cost if you accept limited downside coverage.\n\nMonitoring & cadence\n- Check daily for your technical cluster: 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD (+hist), RSI, VWMA, ATR.\n- Before earnings / regulatory events: increase hedge or reduce exposure; reassess 1–2 trading days post-event for confirmed technical direction.\n- Review positions weekly and after any major news.\n\nWhat I need to give precise levels\n- Paste last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me the current price & timeframe and I will compute 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings and return exact entry, stop, and target levels plus a confidence grade.\n\nLearning to embed going forward\n- Automate rules (SMA/MACD/VWMA/ATR) to remove headline-driven emotion.\n- Size to ATR and always predefine dollar risk.\n- Hedge proactively into event windows, not reactively after the first bad headline.\n\nShort summary recommendation\n- Hold your current exposure, immediately reduce concentration by trimming 20–40% as appropriate, and buy hedges sized to the remaining position ahead of known catalyst windows. Only add new long exposure after the technical cluster you described confirms a bullish setup.\n\nFINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**\n\nMarket report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV.

Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSentiment report:\n\n\nNews report:\n\n\nDebate history:\nRisky Analyst (Round 1): Nice, your plan is tight — HOLD with active de‑risking + disciplined hedging is exactly the asymmetric approach I’d pick for TSLA here. I’ll back that stance, push for a few higher‑edge tweaks, and push back on overly conservative counterarguments (full exit / heavy cashing out). Short, actionable refinements and optional higher‑reward plays below.\n\nWhy HOLD + active hedging is the smarter middle ground\n- Conservative push: “Just sell and avoid volatility.” Rebuttal: TSLA is optionality-rich (software, scale, FSD/robotaxi optionality, charging network). Full exit crystallizes downside and forfeits asymmetric upside. Better to trim, hedge, and stay in the game.\n- Neutral push: “Do nothing until perfect clarity.” Rebuttal: passivity invites headline risk and sudden drawdowns. A modest hedge is cheap insurance relative to permanent capital loss on a high‑volatility name.\n\nActionable immediate checklist (apply today)\n1) Trim (reduce concentration)\n- Target: trim 20–35% of position (use 20% if TSLA is a modest holding; 30–35% if it’s >7–10% of portfolio).\n- Post-trim allocation goal: 3%–6% of portfolio in core TSLA exposure for growth-tolerant accounts; keep a small “optionality” sleeve beyond that if you want more upside.\n\n2) Hedging the remainder (practical & capital-efficient)\nPick one based on budget / risk tolerance:\n- Lean Defensive (capital efficient): buy a 3-month put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM put debit spread) sized to protect ~20%–40% of the remaining notional. Lower cost than straight puts, defined risk.\n- Classic Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 15%–25% OTM call to finance a 10%–15% OTM put. Caps upside but funds protection. Good if you expect range-bound action into catalysts.\n- Stronger Event Hedge: buy straight puts (~10%–15% OTM) sized to 50%–100% of remaining notional for the 2–6 weeks around the catalyst (earnings/regulatory). If expensive, buy a butterfly/vertical to limit cost.\nSizing reminder: hedge to protect the trimmed position — e.g., if you trimmed 30% and have 70% left, hedge 20%–40% of that 70% depending on conviction and event risk.\n\n3) Aggressive/high‑reward alternatives (if you want to chase upside)\n- LEAP collar + core hold: use proceeds from trims to buy LEAP calls (12–18 month) as low-cost asymmetric exposure while keeping a smaller core equity stake fully hedged. Example allocation: 50% of trimmed proceeds into LEAP calls, 50% to cash or safer hedges.\n- Defined-risk bullish spread: buy a deep ITM / near-ATM call debit spread with long-dated expiry to capture directional upside with limited premium bleed.\n- Volatility play around catalyst: if you expect a big move and willing to pay IV, buy a straddle/strangle for the event window sized small vs portfolio (use only if you have a view on realized vs implied vol).\n\n4) Rules to escalate or de‑risk further\n- If daily close < 50 SMA + MACD negative + VWMA > price + RSI < 50 → sell additional 25%–40% of remaining position.\n- If daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation → exit majority (leave a minimal optionality stub or replace with long-dated calls).\n- Pre‑catalyst (2–7 days): increase hedge notional or shorten hedge expiries to cover the event window. Reassess 1–2 days post-event and adjust quickly to new technicals.\n\n5) Profit management on rallies\n- Take incremental profits: liquidate 25%–50% of remaining position when RSI > 85 or MACD hist shows blowoff. Re-deploy into LEAPs or call spreads rather than immediately re-buying full equity if you still want upside exposure.\n\nConcrete option templates (no price required)\n- Defensive (low cost): 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell 1–3 month 20% OTM call, buy 1–3 month 10–15% OTM put; strikes adjusted to net-zero or modest debit.\n- Put spread (defined cost): buy 10% OTM put, sell 20% OTM put (same expiry) sized for 20%–40% protection of remaining notional.\n- LEAP bull: buy 12–18 month ATM or slightly ITM call; size small (10%–30% of trimmed proceeds) to get convex upside with limited capital at risk.\n\nMonitoring cadence (concise)\n- Daily: check 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD, MACD hist, RSI, VWMA, ATR(14).\n- Pre-event: add hedges 2–7 days before earnings/regulatory windows.\n- Post-event: reassess within 1–2 trading days for confirmed direction; trim more or unwind hedges accordingly.\n- Weekly: review position sizing vs portfolio and volatility regime.\n\nHow to implement quickly in your platform\n- If you want exact strike levels and sizes, paste last 60 daily OHLCV or give me current price + expiry windows and I’ll output precise 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings + entry/stop/targets and option strikes sized to your dollar risk.\n- If you don’t provide data: use the templates above and size hedges to protect the dollar amount you trimmed.\n\nShort practical rebuttals to conservative objections\n- “Hedges are wasteful” — true if you hedge permanently; false if you hedge tactically around identifiable catalysts and reallocate to LEAPs for long-term optionality. Insurance cost is insurance paid to avoid catastrophic drawdowns.\n- “Trim too little” — trimming 20–40% is enough to materially reduce concentration while retaining upside. Bigger trims are prudent only if you need to rebalance to core allocation targets or have liquidity constraints.\n\nFinal one-paragraph recommendation\nHold a reduced core TSLA exposure (trim 20–35% depending on concentration), immediately buy a capital-efficient hedge (put spread or collar sized to protect 15%–40% of your remaining notional through the next catalyst), and redeploy some trimmed proceeds into asymmetric long instruments (LEAPs or call spreads) if you want higher-reward upside without full equity risk. Increase hedges into catalyst windows and tighten exits if the 50/200 SMA + MACD + VWMA cluster flips bearish.\n\nWant exact strike/entry/stop levels? Paste the last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me current price and your time horizon and I’ll compute exact indicators, strikes, sizes, and a confidence grade. Risk reminder: options are leveraged and can expire worthless; size accordingly.\n\nLast risky response:\nNice, your plan is tight — HOLD with active de‑risking + disciplined hedging is exactly the asymmetric approach I’d pick for TSLA here.

      "system": "Neutral Analyst: balanced perspective, challenge risky and safe where over/under cautious. Conversational, no special formatting.",
      "user": "Trader plan:\nAgreement: I concur with your plan — HOLD with active de-risking and disciplined hedging is the prudent course right now given the mixed bull/bear case and lack of current price/volume indicator reads.\n\nConcise rationale (why HOLD now)\n- Valuation- and event-sensitivity mean small negatives can produce big drawdowns; but structural positives (scale, software, charging) justify keeping a material allocation for growth-tolerant investors.\n- Without fresh OHLCV indicators I can’t produce precise entry/exit price levels; that uncertainty argues against an aggressive BUY or SELL now.\n- The logical safe path is to reduce concentration, hedge remaining exposure around known catalyst windows, and only add on clear, indicator-confirmed setups.\n\nImmediate action checklist (apply today)\nIf you already hold TSLA\n1) Trim to reduce concentration\n   - Target reduction: 20–40% of current TSLA position depending on how large it is in your portfolio.\n   - Guideline: if TSLA > 5%–7% of portfolio, trim toward 3%–7% total allocation.\n\n2) Hedge the remainder\n   - Conservative hedge: buy puts sized to ~10%–25% of the remaining notional, strikes ~10%–20% OTM, expiries covering next major catalyst (earnings / regulatory windows).\n   - Cheaper alternative: collar — sell calls ~10%–20% OTM to finance put purchase (caps upside).\n   - If you want stronger protection, buy 1:1 puts for a shorter period around the event window.\n\n3) Rule-based escalation\n   - If daily close < 50 SMA + MACD turns negative + VWMA above price + RSI < 50 → sell an additional tranche (another 25%–50% of remaining).\n   - If daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation → exit the bulk (convert residual to a small speculative position or hedge fully).\n\n4) Profit management on rallies\n   - Take incremental profits on parabolic moves (RSI > 85, huge MACD histogram). Re-enter only on disciplined pullbacks that meet your technical rules.\n\nIf you are contemplating new buys\n- Do not initiate full new positions now. If you must add, use starter positions (10%–25% of intended size) and plan to average in only after indicator confirmation (price > 50 & 200 SMA, pullback to 10 EMA with MACD + VWMA confirmation).\n- Risk per trade: 0.5%–1% of portfolio. Size using ATR stops.\n\nIf you are short-oriented\n- Prefer options or spreads over naked short equity. Primary short trigger: close < 50 SMA + expanding negative MACD histogram + VWMA above price on above-average volume.\n\nConcrete option structures (examples)\n- Defensive (low cost): buy a 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 20% OTM call, use proceeds to buy a 10–15% OTM put; adjust strikes to match desired risk/reward.\n- Tactical protection: buy a vertical put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM strikes) to cap protection cost if you accept limited downside coverage.\n\nMonitoring & cadence\n- Check daily for your technical cluster: 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD (+hist), RSI, VWMA, ATR.\n- Before earnings / regulatory events: increase hedge or reduce exposure; reassess 1–2 trading days post-event for confirmed technical direction.\n- Review positions weekly and after any major news.\n\nWhat I need to give precise levels\n- Paste last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me the current price & timeframe and I will compute 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings and return exact entry, stop, and target levels plus a confidence grade.\n\nLearning to embed going forward\n- Automate rules (SMA/MACD/VWMA/ATR) to remove headline-driven emotion.\n- Size to ATR and always predefine dollar risk.\n- Hedge proactively into event windows, not reactively after the first bad headline.\n\nShort summary recommendation\n- Hold your current exposure, immediately reduce concentration by trimming 20–40% as appropriate, and buy hedges sized to the remaining position ahead of known catalyst windows. Only add new long exposure after the technical cluster you described confirms a bullish setup.\n\nFINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**\n\nMarket report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSentiment report:\n\n\nNews report:\n\n\nDebate history:\nRisky Analyst (Round 1): Nice, your plan is tight — HOLD with active de‑risking + disciplined hedging is exactly the asymmetric approach I’d pick for TSLA here. I’ll back that stance, push for a few higher‑edge tweaks, and push back on overly conservative counterarguments (full exit / heavy cashing out). Short, actionable refinements and optional higher‑reward plays below.\n\nWhy HOLD + active hedging is the smarter middle ground\n- Conservative push: “Just sell and avoid volatility.” Rebuttal: TSLA is optionality-rich (software, scale, FSD/robotaxi optionality, charging network). Full exit crystallizes downside and forfeits asymmetric upside. Better to trim, hedge, and stay in the game.\n- Neutral push: “Do nothing until perfect clarity.” Rebuttal: passivity invites headline risk and sudden drawdowns. A modest hedge is cheap insurance relative to permanent capital loss on a high‑volatility name.\n\nActionable immediate checklist (apply today)\n1) Trim (reduce concentration)\n- Target: trim 20–35% of position (use 20% if TSLA is a modest holding; 30–35% if it’s >7–10% of portfolio).\n- Post-trim allocation goal: 3%–6% of portfolio in core TSLA exposure for growth-tolerant accounts; keep a small “optionality” sleeve beyond that if you want more upside.\n\n2) Hedging the remainder (practical & capital-efficient)\nPick one based on budget / risk tolerance:\n- Lean Defensive (capital efficient): buy a 3-month put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM put debit spread) sized to protect ~20%–40% of the remaining notional. Lower cost than straight puts, defined risk.\n- Classic Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 15%–25% OTM call to finance a 10%–15% OTM put. Caps upside but funds protection. Good if you expect range-bound action into catalysts.\n- Stronger Event Hedge: buy straight puts (~10%–15% OTM) sized to 50%–100% of remaining notional for the 2–6 weeks around the catalyst (earnings/regulatory). If expensive, buy a butterfly/vertical to limit cost.\nSizing reminder: hedge to protect the trimmed position — e.g., if you trimmed 30% and have 70% left, hedge 20%–40% of that 70% depending on conviction and event risk.\n\n3) Aggressive/high‑reward alternatives (if you want to chase upside)\n- LEAP collar + core hold: use proceeds from trims to buy LEAP calls (12–18 month) as low-cost asymmetric exposure while keeping a smaller core equity stake fully hedged. Example allocation: 50% of trimmed proceeds into LEAP calls, 50% to cash or safer hedges.\n- Defined-risk bullish spread: buy a deep ITM / near-ATM call debit spread with long-dated expiry to capture directional upside with limited premium bleed.\n- Volatility play around catalyst: if you expect a big move and willing to pay IV, buy a straddle/strangle for the event window sized small vs portfolio (use only if you have a view on realized vs implied vol).\n\n4) Rules to escalate or de‑risk further\n- If daily close < 50 SMA + MACD negative + VWMA > price + RSI < 50 → sell additional 25%–40% of remaining position.\n- If daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation → exit majority (leave a minimal optionality stub or replace with long-dated calls).\n- Pre‑catalyst (2–7 days): increase hedge notional or shorten hedge expiries to cover the event window. Reassess 1–2 days post-event and adjust quickly to new technicals.\n\n5) Profit management on rallies\n- Take incremental profits: liquidate 25%–50% of remaining position when RSI > 85 or MACD hist shows blowoff. Re-deploy into LEAPs or call spreads rather than immediately re-buying full equity if you still want upside exposure.\n\nConcrete option templates (no price required)\n- Defensive (low cost): 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell 1–3 month 20% OTM call, buy 1–3 month 10–15% OTM put; strikes adjusted to net-zero or modest debit.\n- Put spread (defined cost): buy 10% OTM put, sell 20% OTM put (same expiry) sized for 20%–40% protection of remaining notional.\n- LEAP bull: buy 12–18 month ATM or slightly ITM call; size small (10%–30% of trimmed proceeds) to get convex upside with limited capital at risk.\n\nMonitoring cadence (concise)\n- Daily: check 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD, MACD hist, RSI, VWMA, ATR(14).\n- Pre-event: add hedges 2–7 days before earnings/regulatory windows.\n- Post-event: reassess within 1–2 trading days for confirmed direction; trim more or unwind hedges accordingly.\n- Weekly: review position sizing vs portfolio and volatility regime.\n\nHow to implement quickly in your platform\n- If you want exact strike levels and sizes, paste last 60 daily OHLCV or give me current price + expiry windows and I’ll output precise 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings + entry/stop/targets and option strikes sized to your dollar risk.\n- If you don’t provide data: use the templates above and size hedges to protect the dollar amount you trimmed.\n\nShort practical rebuttals to conservative objections\n- “Hedges are wasteful” — true if you hedge permanently; false if you hedge tactically around identifiable catalysts and reallocate to LEAPs for long-term optionality. Insurance cost is insurance paid to avoid catastrophic drawdowns.\n- “Trim too little” — trimming 20–40% is enough to materially reduce concentration while retaining upside. Bigger trims are prudent only if you need to rebalance to core allocation targets or have liquidity constraints.\n\nFinal one-paragraph recommendation\nHold a reduced core TSLA exposure (trim 20–35% depending on concentration), immediately buy a capital-efficient hedge (put spread or collar sized to protect 15%–40% of your remaining notional through the next catalyst), and redeploy some trimmed proceeds into asymmetric long instruments (LEAPs or call spreads) if you want higher-reward upside without full equity risk. Increase hedges into catalyst windows and tighten exits if the 50/200 SMA + MACD + VWMA cluster flips bearish.\n\nWant exact strike/entry/stop levels? Paste the last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me current price and your time horizon and I’ll compute exact indicators, strikes, sizes, and a confidence grade. Risk reminder: options are leveraged and can expire worthless; size accordingly.\nSafe Analyst (Round 1): Good plan — HOLD with active de‑risking and disciplined hedging is the sensible, capital‑preserving posture here. Below I tighten and operationalize your checklist so you can act immediately and without guesswork.\n\nConcise rationale (agreeing with you)\n- TSLA is event‑ and valuation‑sensitive: small negatives can cause outsized drawdowns, so full exposure is risky.\n- Structural positives justify keeping material optionality for growth‑tolerant investors — but not without reducing concentration and adding tactical protection.\n- Without current OHLCV I won’t give exact strikes/stops; the right move now is trim → hedge → monitor, and only add after clear indicator confirmation.\n\nImmediate action (to apply today)\n1) Trim concentration\n- Target trim: 20–40% of your current TSLA position depending on how large it is.\n- Practical guideline: if TSLA > 5–7% of portfolio, trim toward a 3–7% allocation; if it’s already small (<3%) trim minimally or skip.\n\n2) Hedge the remaining position\n- Three practical templates (choose based on cost / conviction):\n  - Low‑cost put spread (defined risk): buy a 3‑month put 10% OTM and sell a deeper 20% OTM put sized to protect 15–40% of remaining notional.\n  - Collar (income‑funded): sell a 1–3 month call 10–20% OTM and buy a 1–3 month put 10–15% OTM; call sale finances most/all of the put.\n  - Strong event hedge: buy straight puts (10–15% OTM) sized to cover 50–100% of remaining notional for the 2–6 week event window if downside risk is high.\n- How to choose strike from current price P:\n  - 10% OTM put strike = round(P × 0.90)\n  - 15% OTM put strike = round(P × 0.85)\n  - 20% OTM call strike = round(P × 1.20)\n- Contracts sizing:\n  - Each options contract ≈ 100 shares. To hedge X% of shares: contracts = ceil((shares_owned × X%) / 100).\n  - To hedge by notional: notional_to_hedge = shares_owned × P × X%; contracts = ceil(notional_to_hedge / (100 × strike_price)).\n\n3) Rule‑based escalation (automatic de‑risking)\n- Sell additional tranche (25–50% of remaining) if: daily close < 50 SMA AND MACD turns negative AND VWMA > price AND RSI < 50.\n- Exit bulk if: daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation (daily volume > recent average and VWMA confirming breakdown).\n- Pre‑catalyst (2–7 days): increase hedge notional or shorten hedge expiries to match event window.\n\n4) Profit management on rallies\n- Take incremental profits: scale out 25%–50% when RSI > 85 or MACD hist shows blow‑off. Reinvest proceeds into asymmetric instruments (LEAPs or call spreads) if you want upside while limiting equity risk.\n\nMonitoring cadence (implement today)\n- Daily: check 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD + histogram, RSI, VWMA, ATR(14).\n- Pre‑event: hedge 2–7 days before earnings / regulatory announcements; reassess 1–2 trading days after the event.\n- Weekly: review allocation vs portfolio target and volatility regime; adjust hedge sizing if ATR rises.\n\nExecution practicalities & risk reminders\n- Watch option liquidity and bid/ask spreads; use limit orders for fills.\n- Collar caps upside — acceptable if you want financed protection. Put spreads limit protection range but cut cost.\n- Options expire; time your protection for the window you need. If implied vol is very expensive, prefer defined‑risk spreads or smaller notional hedges.\n- Taxes, margin and assignment risk on short calls — consider cash‑secured or close before assignment deadlines.\n\nWhat I need to give exact levels\n- Paste last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me: current TSLA price, shares owned, current % of portfolio, and the catalyst date/timeframe. I will compute 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings and return exact entry/exit/stops, candidate option strikes/expiries, contract counts, and a confidence grade.\n\nIf you want, paste current price + shares + next catalyst date and I’ll give exact strike examples and the contract count to implement your hedge immediately.\n\nLast risky response:\nNice, your plan is tight — HOLD with active de‑risking + disciplined hedging is exactly the asymmetric approach I’d pick for TSLA here.

      "user": "Trader plan:\nAgreement: I concur with your plan — HOLD with active de-risking and disciplined hedging is the prudent course right now given the mixed bull/bear case and lack of current price/volume indicator reads.\n\nConcise rationale (why HOLD now)\n- Valuation- and event-sensitivity mean small negatives can produce big drawdowns; but structural positives (scale, software, charging) justify keeping a material allocation for growth-tolerant investors.\n- Without fresh OHLCV indicators I can’t produce precise entry/exit price levels; that uncertainty argues against an aggressive BUY or SELL now.\n- The logical safe path is to reduce concentration, hedge remaining exposure around known catalyst windows, and only add on clear, indicator-confirmed setups.\n\nImmediate action checklist (apply today)\nIf you already hold TSLA\n1) Trim to reduce concentration\n   - Target reduction: 20–40% of current TSLA position depending on how large it is in your portfolio.\n   - Guideline: if TSLA > 5%–7% of portfolio, trim toward 3%–7% total allocation.\n\n2) Hedge the remainder\n   - Conservative hedge: buy puts sized to ~10%–25% of the remaining notional, strikes ~10%–20% OTM, expiries covering next major catalyst (earnings / regulatory windows).\n   - Cheaper alternative: collar — sell calls ~10%–20% OTM to finance put purchase (caps upside).\n   - If you want stronger protection, buy 1:1 puts for a shorter period around the event window.\n\n3) Rule-based escalation\n   - If daily close < 50 SMA + MACD turns negative + VWMA above price + RSI < 50 → sell an additional tranche (another 25%–50% of remaining).\n   - If daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation → exit the bulk (convert residual to a small speculative position or hedge fully).\n\n4) Profit management on rallies\n   - Take incremental profits on parabolic moves (RSI > 85, huge MACD histogram). Re-enter only on disciplined pullbacks that meet your technical rules.\n\nIf you are contemplating new buys\n- Do not initiate full new positions now. If you must add, use starter positions (10%–25% of intended size) and plan to average in only after indicator confirmation (price > 50 & 200 SMA, pullback to 10 EMA with MACD + VWMA confirmation).\n- Risk per trade: 0.5%–1% of portfolio. Size using ATR stops.\n\nIf you are short-oriented\n- Prefer options or spreads over naked short equity. Primary short trigger: close < 50 SMA + expanding negative MACD histogram + VWMA above price on above-average volume.\n\nConcrete option structures (examples)\n- Defensive (low cost): buy a 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 20% OTM call, use proceeds to buy a 10–15% OTM put; adjust strikes to match desired risk/reward.\n- Tactical protection: buy a vertical put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM strikes) to cap protection cost if you accept limited downside coverage.\n\nMonitoring & cadence\n- Check daily for your technical cluster: 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD (+hist), RSI, VWMA, ATR.\n- Before earnings / regulatory events: increase hedge or reduce exposure; reassess 1–2 trading days post-event for confirmed technical direction.\n- Review positions weekly and after any major news.\n\nWhat I need to give precise levels\n- Paste last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me the current price & timeframe and I will compute 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings and return exact entry, stop, and target levels plus a confidence grade.\n\nLearning to embed going forward\n- Automate rules (SMA/MACD/VWMA/ATR) to remove headline-driven emotion.\n- Size to ATR and always predefine dollar risk.\n- Hedge proactively into event windows, not reactively after the first bad headline.\n\nShort summary recommendation\n- Hold your current exposure, immediately reduce concentration by trimming 20–40% as appropriate, and buy hedges sized to the remaining position ahead of known catalyst windows. Only add new long exposure after the technical cluster you described confirms a bullish setup.\n\nFINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**\n\nDebate history:\nRisky Analyst (Round 1): Nice, your plan is tight — HOLD with active de‑risking + disciplined hedging is exactly the asymmetric approach I’d pick for TSLA here. I’ll back that stance, push for a few higher‑edge tweaks, and push back on overly conservative counterarguments (full exit / heavy cashing out). Short, actionable refinements and optional higher‑reward plays below.\n\nWhy HOLD + active hedging is the smarter middle ground\n- Conservative push: “Just sell and avoid volatility.” Rebuttal: TSLA is optionality-rich (software, scale, FSD/robotaxi optionality, charging network). Full exit crystallizes downside and forfeits asymmetric upside. Better to trim, hedge, and stay in the game.\n- Neutral push: “Do nothing until perfect clarity.” Rebuttal: passivity invites headline risk and sudden drawdowns. A modest hedge is cheap insurance relative to permanent capital loss on a high‑volatility name.\n\nActionable immediate checklist (apply today)\n1) Trim (reduce concentration)\n- Target: trim 20–35% of position (use 20% if TSLA is a modest holding; 30–35% if it’s >7–10% of portfolio).\n- Post-trim allocation goal: 3%–6% of portfolio in core TSLA exposure for growth-tolerant accounts; keep a small “optionality” sleeve beyond that if you want more upside.\n\n2) Hedging the remainder (practical & capital-efficient)\nPick one based on budget / risk tolerance:\n- Lean Defensive (capital efficient): buy a 3-month put spread (e.g., 10%–20% OTM put debit spread) sized to protect ~20%–40% of the remaining notional. Lower cost than straight puts, defined risk.\n- Classic Collar (income-funded): sell a 1–3 month 15%–25% OTM call to finance a 10%–15% OTM put. Caps upside but funds protection. Good if you expect range-bound action into catalysts.\n- Stronger Event Hedge: buy straight puts (~10%–15% OTM) sized to 50%–100% of remaining notional for the 2–6 weeks around the catalyst (earnings/regulatory). If expensive, buy a butterfly/vertical to limit cost.\nSizing reminder: hedge to protect the trimmed position — e.g., if you trimmed 30% and have 70% left, hedge 20%–40% of that 70% depending on conviction and event risk.\n\n3) Aggressive/high‑reward alternatives (if you want to chase upside)\n- LEAP collar + core hold: use proceeds from trims to buy LEAP calls (12–18 month) as low-cost asymmetric exposure while keeping a smaller core equity stake fully hedged. Example allocation: 50% of trimmed proceeds into LEAP calls, 50% to cash or safer hedges.\n- Defined-risk bullish spread: buy a deep ITM / near-ATM call debit spread with long-dated expiry to capture directional upside with limited premium bleed.\n- Volatility play around catalyst: if you expect a big move and willing to pay IV, buy a straddle/strangle for the event window sized small vs portfolio (use only if you have a view on realized vs implied vol).\n\n4) Rules to escalate or de‑risk further\n- If daily close < 50 SMA + MACD negative + VWMA > price + RSI < 50 → sell additional 25%–40% of remaining position.\n- If daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation → exit majority (leave a minimal optionality stub or replace with long-dated calls).\n- Pre‑catalyst (2–7 days): increase hedge notional or shorten hedge expiries to cover the event window. Reassess 1–2 days post-event and adjust quickly to new technicals.\n\n5) Profit management on rallies\n- Take incremental profits: liquidate 25%–50% of remaining position when RSI > 85 or MACD hist shows blowoff. Re-deploy into LEAPs or call spreads rather than immediately re-buying full equity if you still want upside exposure.\n\nConcrete option templates (no price required)\n- Defensive (low cost): 3-month 15% OTM put sized to 15% of remaining notional.\n- Collar (income-funded): sell 1–3 month 20% OTM call, buy 1–3 month 10–15% OTM put; strikes adjusted to net-zero or modest debit.\n- Put spread (defined cost): buy 10% OTM put, sell 20% OTM put (same expiry) sized for 20%–40% protection of remaining notional.\n- LEAP bull: buy 12–18 month ATM or slightly ITM call; size small (10%–30% of trimmed proceeds) to get convex upside with limited capital at risk.\n\nMonitoring cadence (concise)\n- Daily: check 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD, MACD hist, RSI, VWMA, ATR(14).\n- Pre-event: add hedges 2–7 days before earnings/regulatory windows.\n- Post-event: reassess within 1–2 trading days for confirmed direction; trim more or unwind hedges accordingly.\n- Weekly: review position sizing vs portfolio and volatility regime.\n\nHow to implement quickly in your platform\n- If you want exact strike levels and sizes, paste last 60 daily OHLCV or give me current price + expiry windows and I’ll output precise 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings + entry/stop/targets and option strikes sized to your dollar risk.\n- If you don’t provide data: use the templates above and size hedges to protect the dollar amount you trimmed.\n\nShort practical rebuttals to conservative objections\n- “Hedges are wasteful” — true if you hedge permanently; false if you hedge tactically around identifiable catalysts and reallocate to LEAPs for long-term optionality. Insurance cost is insurance paid to avoid catastrophic drawdowns.\n- “Trim too little” — trimming 20–40% is enough to materially reduce concentration while retaining upside. Bigger trims are prudent only if you need to rebalance to core allocation targets or have liquidity constraints.\n\nFinal one-paragraph recommendation\nHold a reduced core TSLA exposure (trim 20–35% depending on concentration), immediately buy a capital-efficient hedge (put spread or collar sized to protect 15%–40% of your remaining notional through the next catalyst), and redeploy some trimmed proceeds into asymmetric long instruments (LEAPs or call spreads) if you want higher-reward upside without full equity risk. Increase hedges into catalyst windows and tighten exits if the 50/200 SMA + MACD + VWMA cluster flips bearish.\n\nWant exact strike/entry/stop levels? Paste the last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me current price and your time horizon and I’ll compute exact indicators, strikes, sizes, and a confidence grade. Risk reminder: options are leveraged and can expire worthless; size accordingly.\nSafe Analyst (Round 1): Good plan — HOLD with active de‑risking and disciplined hedging is the sensible, capital‑preserving posture here. Below I tighten and operationalize your checklist so you can act immediately and without guesswork.\n\nConcise rationale (agreeing with you)\n- TSLA is event‑ and valuation‑sensitive: small negatives can cause outsized drawdowns, so full exposure is risky.\n- Structural positives justify keeping material optionality for growth‑tolerant investors — but not without reducing concentration and adding tactical protection.\n- Without current OHLCV I won’t give exact strikes/stops; the right move now is trim → hedge → monitor, and only add after clear indicator confirmation.\n\nImmediate action (to apply today)\n1) Trim concentration\n- Target trim: 20–40% of your current TSLA position depending on how large it is.\n- Practical guideline: if TSLA > 5–7% of portfolio, trim toward a 3–7% allocation; if it’s already small (<3%) trim minimally or skip.\n\n2) Hedge the remaining position\n- Three practical templates (choose based on cost / conviction):\n  - Low‑cost put spread (defined risk): buy a 3‑month put 10% OTM and sell a deeper 20% OTM put sized to protect 15–40% of remaining notional.\n  - Collar (income‑funded): sell a 1–3 month call 10–20% OTM and buy a 1–3 month put 10–15% OTM; call sale finances most/all of the put.\n  - Strong event hedge: buy straight puts (10–15% OTM) sized to cover 50–100% of remaining notional for the 2–6 week event window if downside risk is high.\n- How to choose strike from current price P:\n  - 10% OTM put strike = round(P × 0.90)\n  - 15% OTM put strike = round(P × 0.85)\n  - 20% OTM call strike = round(P × 1.20)\n- Contracts sizing:\n  - Each options contract ≈ 100 shares. To hedge X% of shares: contracts = ceil((shares_owned × X%) / 100).\n  - To hedge by notional: notional_to_hedge = shares_owned × P × X%; contracts = ceil(notional_to_hedge / (100 × strike_price)).\n\n3) Rule‑based escalation (automatic de‑risking)\n- Sell additional tranche (25–50% of remaining) if: daily close < 50 SMA AND MACD turns negative AND VWMA > price AND RSI < 50.\n- Exit bulk if: daily close < 200 SMA with volume confirmation (daily volume > recent average and VWMA confirming breakdown).\n- Pre‑catalyst (2–7 days): increase hedge notional or shorten hedge expiries to match event window.\n\n4) Profit management on rallies\n- Take incremental profits: scale out 25%–50% when RSI > 85 or MACD hist shows blow‑off. Reinvest proceeds into asymmetric instruments (LEAPs or call spreads) if you want upside while limiting equity risk.\n\nMonitoring cadence (implement today)\n- Daily: check 50/200 SMA alignment, MACD + histogram, RSI, VWMA, ATR(14).\n- Pre‑event: hedge 2–7 days before earnings / regulatory announcements; reassess 1–2 trading days after the event.\n- Weekly: review allocation vs portfolio target and volatility regime; adjust hedge sizing if ATR rises.\n\nExecution practicalities & risk reminders\n- Watch option liquidity and bid/ask spreads; use limit orders for fills.\n- Collar caps upside — acceptable if you want financed protection. Put spreads limit protection range but cut cost.\n- Options expire; time your protection for the window you need. If implied vol is very expensive, prefer defined‑risk spreads or smaller notional hedges.\n- Taxes, margin and assignment risk on short calls — consider cash‑secured or close before assignment deadlines.\n\nWhat I need to give exact levels\n- Paste last 60 daily OHLCV or tell me: current TSLA price, shares owned, current % of portfolio, and the catalyst date/timeframe. I will compute 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD readings and return exact entry/exit/stops, candidate option strikes/expiries, contract counts, and a confidence grade.\n\nIf you want, paste current price + shares + next catalyst date and I’ll give exact strike examples and the contract count to implement your hedge immediately.\nNeutral Analyst (Round 1): Plan looks sensible and balanced — HOLD with a 20–40% trim + active, disciplined hedging is an appropriate middle path given TSLA’s event/valuation sensitivity and the lack of current indicator reads.\n\nIf you want me to produce precise, actionable levels now I’ll need a few inputs. Pick one of the two options below and paste the data:\n\nOption A — paste recent OHLCV (best)\n- Provide the last 60 daily candles (or last 100 hourly candles for intraday). Format: CSV or rows with Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (one line per candle). Example line: 2025-10-17,250.00,255.20,248.10,252.30,43,500,000\n- Tell me which timeframe you want analyzed (daily swing or intraday hour/15m).\n- Tell me next catalyst date/window (e.g., next earnings date or regulatory hearing).\n- Tell me shares owned and total portfolio value (or current % allocation).\n- Tell me preferred hedge style (puts / put spread / collar) or budget for hedge (max $ or % of portfolio to spend).\n\nOption B — quick inputs if you don’t want to paste candles\n- Current TSLA price (P)\n- Shares owned\n- Portfolio value (or % allocation)\n- Desired trim amount (if you want me to pick, say 20–40%)\n- Hedge coverage target (e.g., protect 20% / 50% / 100% of remaining notional)\n- Catalyst date/window and desired hedge expiry range (e.g., 1 month, 3 months)\n- Hedge preference (puts, put spread, collar) and risk tolerance (conservative / balanced / aggressive)\n\nWhat I will deliver after you provide one of those:\n- Computed indicators (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, ATR(14), VWMA, MACD line & histogram, RSI) on your requested timeframe.\n- Clear bias (bull/neutral/bear) and confidence grade.\n- Exact entry, stop, and initial target levels (price and %), with ATR-based stop distances and trailing rules.\n- Option strike & expiry suggestions and the contract counts to implement your desired hedge coverage (with simple contract math).\n- Approximate hedge cost estimate (premiums) and an execution checklist (limit orders, expected spreads, when to roll/unwind).\n- A one‑paragraph recommended trade action you can execute immediately.\n\nIf you want a very quick fallback (no data), here are formulas you can apply yourself immediately to implement the plan:\n- 10% OTM put strike ≈ round(P × 0.90), 15% OTM ≈ round(P × 0.85), 20% OTM call ≈ round(P × 1.20).\n- Contracts to hedge X% of shares = ceil((shares_owned × X%) / 100).\n- Conservative ATR stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR); aggressive = entry − (1.0 × ATR).\n- Trim sizing rule: if TSLA > 7% of portfolio → trim toward 3%–7%; otherwise trim 20% if already small.\n\nTell me which option (A or B) you prefer and paste the data / inputs. I’ll return the full, data-driven plan with exact levels and contract counts.\n\nMarket report:\nI can’t compute current indicator values or give a data-driven BUY/HOLD/SELL because no TSLA price/volume history was supplied. To be useful now I will:\n\n- Select up to 8 complementary indicators appropriate for TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven, volume-driven moves).\n- Explain why each was chosen for this stock and strategy types (swing/trend following + risk management).\n- Provide a detailed, actionable framework and the exact signals to watch for on those indicators (entry, exit, stop placement, confirmation rules, and how to avoid false signals).\n- Ask what timeframe / recent OHLCV you want analyzed or invite you to paste recent candles so I can apply this framework to current data.\n\nSelected indicators (max 8) and why they complement each other for TSLA\n1) close_10_ema (10 EMA)\n   - Role: short-term, responsive trend/momentum filter and entry trigger.\n   - Why for TSLA: captures quick shifts in momentum (TSLA often moves fast intraday/swing). Use to time entries on pullbacks or intraday momentum bursts.\n\n2) close_50_sma (50 SMA)\n   - Role: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps separate pullbacks inside an uptrend vs. trend break. When price stays above 50 SMA, favors long bias; below, caution.\n\n3) close_200_sma (200 SMA)\n   - Role: long-term trend benchmark (major trend filter).\n   - Why for TSLA: big-picture trend confirmation. Important for sizing and whether to treat moves as corrections vs. structural reversals.\n\n4) macd (MACD line) — as the primary MACD signal\n   - Role: momentum trend and crossovers (with MACD signal line) to detect trend shifts.\n   - Why for TSLA: identifies trending momentum changes beyond simple moving-average crossovers; helpful in spotting sustained move onset.\n\n5) macdh (MACD histogram)\n   - Role: visualizes momentum strength and early divergence; shows increasing/decreasing momentum before a MACD crossover.\n   - Why for TSLA: often gives earlier warning of momentum acceleration/deceleration that precedes rapid TSLA moves.\n\n6) rsi (Relative Strength Index)\n   - Role: identifies overbought/oversold extremes and divergence with price.\n   - Why for TSLA: helps spot exhaustion in momentum. Because TSLA can remain extended, combine RSI with trend filters (50/200 SMA).\n\n7) atr (Average True Range)\n   - Role: current volatility measurement for sizing and stop placement.\n   - Why for TSLA: ATR-driven stops avoid getting run over during normal TSLA volatility spikes; helps scale position sizing when volatility rises.\n\n8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)\n   - Role: trend confirmation with volume weighting (price + volume signal).\n   - Why for TSLA: TSLA moves often come with strong volume surges; VWMA helps confirm whether a breakout has volume support vs. a thin wick move.\n\nHow these indicators work together (complementarity)\n- Multi-timeframe trend filter: close_200_sma (long) + close_50_sma (medium) — decide bias (favor longs when price > both; favor shorts when price < both).\n- Entry timing: close_10_ema for quick entries/confirmations on pullbacks; MACD cross/histogram shifts confirm momentum direction.\n- Momentum confirmation: macd/macdh + rsi — MACD shows trend direction and strength; MACD histogram early signals; RSI highlights overbought/oversold and divergence.\n- Volume confirmation: vwma — ensures moves are supported by volume (higher confidence on VWMA-aligned breakouts).\n- Risk management: atr — sets volatility-aware stops and position sizing.\n\nDetailed, nuanced framework and signal rules to apply to TSLA (useful without current data)\nI. Define timeframe & bias\n- Choose your trading horizon:\n  - Intraday / Day trade: 5m–60m charts. Use 10 EMA (on that timeframe), MACD tuned shorter (default OK), ATR of same timeframe for stops.\n  - Swing trade: Daily charts (recommended for most retail swing traders). Use default MACD, 10 EMA (daily), 50/200 SMA daily, daily ATR for stop sizing.\n- Bias rule (daily example):\n  - Bull bias: price > 200 SMA and > 50 SMA → prioritize long setups only.\n  - Neutral/transition: price between 50 and 200 SMA → trade smaller size; prefer range/mean-reversion entries.\n  - Bear bias: price < 50 and < 200 SMA → permit shorts or wait for evidence of trend reversal.\n\nII. Entry signals (with confirmation stack)\n- Trend-following long entry (swing):\n  1. Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA (aligned).\n  2. Pullback to 10 EMA or a shallow pull to the 50 SMA (prefer pullback that holds the 10 EMA).\n  3. MACD histogram turning up after smaller negative bars (early momentum return) and MACD line crossing toward signal line.\n  4. RSI above ~45 (not deeply oversold) — indicates bullish momentum recovering; avoid entries if RSI > 80 (overextended).\n  5. VWMA near or below price and rising on the breakout/pullback confirmation (volume confirms).\n  Entry type: limit order near 10 EMA or market on confirmed MACD cross with a volume spike.\n\n- Breakout long:\n  1. Price breaks above a consolidation/resistance candle with close above the high and above VWMA.\n  2. MACD histogram expanding positive; MACD line above signal line ideally.\n  3. RSI ideally between 50–80 (not extreme beyond 90).\n  4. Volume on breakout > recent average and VWMA trending up.\n  Entry: buy on close above resistance or a retest if price returns, confirm MACD + VWMA.\n\n- Short or reversal entry:\n  1. Price below both 50 and 200 SMA (bear bias) or a clear failure at 50/200 SMA.\n  2. MACD histogram turning negative, MACD line crossing below signal line.\n  3. RSI below 55 and falling (or negative divergence — price new highs but RSI lower).\n  4. Volume confirming breakdown with price below VWMA.\n  Entry: short on confirmed breakdown with stop above immediate supply level or moving average.\n\nIII. Exit and stop placement (volatility-aware)\n- ATR-based stop guidance (daily example):\n  - Conservative: place stop = entry − (1.5 × ATR(14)).\n  - Aggressive: stop = entry − (1.0 × ATR(14)).\n  - For shorts, mirror above entry.\n- Profit targets:\n  - Swing: initial target 1.5×–3× ATR risk (risk:reward).\n  - Trail using 10 EMA or a fraction of ATR (e.g., trail stop at 0.75 × ATR below recent swing highs/lows).\n  - If MACD histogram collapses or MACD crosses back against position, consider partial or full exit.\n- Use VWMA and 50 SMA as dynamic exit levels in trending situations (e.g., exit when price closes below VWMA + confirmation).\n\nIV. Filtering false signals (TSLA-specific caution)\n- Avoid taking breakout longs on thin-volume breakouts — require VWMA to confirm (price must be above VWMA and VWMA trending up).\n- If RSI is extreme (>85) concurrent with very large positive MACD histogram, be cautious — price may be in terminal phase of run; wait for a pullback before entering.\n- Watch for divergences:\n  - Bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD histogram lower highs, RSI lower highs) on TSLA often precedes sharp pullbacks — exit or hedge.\n  - Bullish divergence on pullbacks to 50 SMA/200 SMA with MACD histogram decreasing in negative magnitude + rising VWMA on reversal — higher-probability long setups.\n\nV. Position sizing with ATR + volatility regime\n- Determine baseline position size based on risk per trade (% of account).\n- Convert dollar risk into share size using ATR-based stop distance: shares = (dollar risk) / (stop distance).\n- Reduce size when ATR spikes (volatility regime change) and increase only if account risk remains constant.\n\nVI. Example scenario templates (apply when you have data)\n- Bull continuation after earnings/news:\n  - Price gaps above 50/200 SMA with strong volume; MACD histogram expands; RSI 60–85. Action: wait for a small flag/pullback to 10 EMA or VWMA retest; buy with ATR stop.\n- Pullback in uptrend:\n  - Price pulls to 10 EMA but remains above 50 SMA; MACD histogram flattens and turns positive; RSI rebounds from ~40. Action: buy near 10 EMA, stop below recent low at 1.25× ATR.\n- False breakout / volumeless wick:\n  - Price spikes to new high but VWMA is flat/declining and MACD histogram shows no expansion; RSI extreme. Action: avoid buying; look for reversal or a retest to VWMA with volume.\n\nWhat I cannot do without your data\n- I cannot compute current indicator values (EMA/SMA/MACD/RSI/ATR/VWMA) or give a definitive trade call on today’s TSLA price.\n- I cannot detect present divergences, current volatility regime, or recent volume profile.\n\nHow you can proceed (two quick options)\n1) Paste recent OHLCV (e.g., last 60 daily candles or last 100 1h candles) and the timeframe you care about — I will compute and deliver a full, data-driven report with indicator readings, trend interpretation, entry/exit recommendations, and a final trade suggestion.\n2) If you want immediate guidance without giving raw data, tell me your timeframe (intraday/swing), risk tolerance, and whether you want long-only or include shorts — I’ll tailor concrete rules and an example trade plan you can apply manually to your charting platform.\n\nSummary — quick checklist for TSLA monitoring\n- Confirm long bias: price > 200 & 50 SMA; prefer buying pullbacks to 10 EMA or retests after volume-backed breakouts.\n- Confirm momentum: MACD histogram expanding + MACD line above signal line.\n- Confirm volume: VWMA rising and price above VWMA on breakouts.\n- Manage risk: ATR-based stops and size to avoid large drawdowns during volatility spikes.\n- Watch divergence: RSI + MACD histogram divergences often precede sharp reversals in TSLA.\n\nMarkdown summary table (concise organized reference)\n\n| Indicator | Purpose | What to watch on TSLA | How to use (entry/exit/stop) |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/entry filter | Price hold/retest on pullbacks; quick cross above/below | Enter on pullback hold or momentum cross; trail exit with 10 EMA |\n| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend S/R | Price above = bullish bias; acts as support on pullbacks | Prefer longs above 50; stop under 50 for larger risk |\n| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above => structural bull; failing 200 => large caution | Use as top-level trend filter; big stops/exits if broken |\n| macd | Trend momentum & crossovers | MACD line vs signal cross; trending direction | Use crossover + trend alignment to trigger entries |\n| macdh | Momentum strength / early divergence | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences vs price | Early momentum confirmation; exit on weakening histogram |\n| rsi | Overbought/oversold & divergence | RSI >70 extreme; RSI divergence with price highs | Avoid entering at extreme RSI; look for divergences to exit |\n| atr | Volatility measurement | Rising ATR = higher expected range | Position sizing & ATR-based stop placement |\n| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend/validation | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA on breakouts | Confirm breakouts; avoid low-volume breakouts |\n\nIf you want a data-driven analysis, paste the timeframe and the recent OHLCV (or allow me to compute from your platform data), and I’ll apply the above indicators to TSLA and produce a detailed, actionable trade plan with exact entry, stop, target, and confidence level.\n\nSentiment report:\n\n\nNews report:\n\n\nFundamentals report:\n\n\nPast reflections:\n(none)"
